> üë©‚Äçüé® Paint a randomised harmonograph with a URL


## Usage

The URL will return an SVG of a randomised harmonograph with a `#000` stroke color, `1px` stroke width and a size of `700px`:

[https://harmonograph.now.sh/](https://harmonograph.now.sh/)

<img src="https://harmonograph.now.sh/" alt="Randomised lissajous curves" width="500">

You can provide your own stroke color, stroke width and size by adding to the URL:
[https://harmonograph.now.sh/red/0.5/100](https://harmonograph.now.sh/red/0.5/100)

<img src="https://harmonograph.now.sh/red/0.5/100" width="100" alt="Randomised lissajous curves with 0.5 stroke width, 100 size and red stroke color">
